                        <li><strong>a. Physical Safeguards:</strong> All paper-based records, such as medical charts, consent forms, and registration documents, are stored in secure, locked cabinets. Access is strictly limited to authorized personnel who need the information to provide care or manage operations. Access logs and internal procedures are in place to ensure accountability and prevent unauthorized entry.</li>
                        <li><strong>b.

                        <li><strong>c. Administrative Safeguards:</strong> We have established policies and procedures for managing and protecting patient information. All staff members receive regular training on privacy laws, data protection principles, and the correct handling of sensitive information.</li>
